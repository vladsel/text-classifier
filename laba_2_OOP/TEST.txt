In many European countries Christmas remains the greatest winter holiday. But Russian people more like and appreciate New Year. But it doesn’t matter because there is the magic of December everywhere.
Young and old people prepare for the holiday in advance. There are many New Year traditions. Some people try to make a wish when it is time of chimes. Most of them watch TV and listen to their president’s speech.
Parents prepare gifts for their children. And they are happy to see their kids’ joy and merry exclamations. Someone waits for fashionable computer game or another expensive present. And some children are happy to get only chocolate figures, a few mandarins and crunchy biscuits. Young people like to exchange gifts secretly. It means that nobody knows who prepared a present and for whom.
And of course, everybody love New Year because after that there are a lot of days when adults can have a rest. Children have winter holidays. It means that all the family can be together. All of us have kept these days in our memories since the childhood, when we with delighted eyes shared these unique moments of December magic

My 18-years-old brother has found a job in a cultural centre in the suburbs. He works as a volunteer. He does volunteer work twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday. My uncle was a person who advised him to do this.
Our uncle has been working in this cultural centre for 6 years. He writes programs of seminar and workshops for teenagers. This centre is a kind of club for people from 14 to 19. We, teenagers, can come there for pleasure, talk and learn more about modern culture such as theater, dance, music, etc. My uncle enjoys working with teenagers. He finds them nice, dynamic and full of ideas.
My brother also likes to work in this cultural centre because there are many kinds of activities. There are hip-hop and rap classes. Of course, it depends on the city but often there are also theater and dance classes; and cooking workshops. All these classes are always very popular among the teenagers.
My brother enjoys his volunteer work because he can help young people to choose the direction of their future professional way.

The year begins on the 1st of January; it is New Year’s Day. This holiday is more popular among the Scottish. The other people of the UK more appreciate Christmas. On the 27th of January the British people have Holocaust Memorial Day. February, 14 is a Valentine’s Day, lovers exchange their gifts, and they go to the restaurant as usual.
In March, when the trees begin to bloom, spring comes. The last Sunday of March, they celebrate Mother’s Day. Children prepare cards, poems and songs for their mums. Another important spring holiday is Easter. In Britain there are similar traditions like in Russia. On 1st of May they don’t work, because it’s a Labor Day. They decorate their houses and the traditional maypole with garlands and ribbons.
Then they dance around the maypole.
In June, students take the exams at the end of the year. Then they spend holidays with joy. They go out to the streets to meet friends and to listen to the concerts. It is very popular. On the 9th of June all the British people celebrate Queen’s Official Birthday. This national holiday has a strange thing because the Queen was born indeed on the 21st of April.
In July many people go to Wimbledon to watch Championship. During two weeks this place becomes a centre of world tennis. In the end of August children begin to prepare their school bags. It’s time of ‘back to school’.
In autumn the leaves begin to fall down. September is the first harvest time. The 21st of October is an Apple day in Britain. They cook apple pies and other dishes made of apples. In November they celebrate one of the nosiest holidays they have. It’s Guy Fawkes Day and Bonfire Night. It is celebrated on the 5th of November and dedicated by the historical event which happened in 1605.
In December winter comes. The children are waiting for Santa Claus. Christmas is a great family holiday. The whole family gets together at the table on the eve of December, 24.

Rugby is a popular sport in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and France. In recent years Italy has become a great rugby nation. It competes with England, Wales, Scotland, France, and Ireland at the Six Nations Championship. It’s an annual rugby competition. All these teams are dreaming of Grand Slam. The Grand Slam means to win all the matches of the competition.
But now in addition to the Six Nations Championship, the Rugby World Cup takes place this year. It is the only time Northern hemisphere teams meet teams from the Southern hemisphere in a great competition. Apart from the UK the spirit of rugby is very popular in Australia and New Zealand. That is why the teams of the southern hemisphere are New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.
They can also add Argentina which is also good at rugby very well.
Rugby is associated with three main values: respect, team spirit and courage. It can also be said that rugby fans behave very well before, during and after matches. There are no cases of violence in the grandstands. And if you have your favorite rugby team, you can safely go to the stadium, watch the World Cup and support your team.

This morning I get up at a half past six o’clock. It’s still dark. I feel tired. I went to bed at 1 am and did not sleep enough. If a person doesn’t sleep eight hours, it’s unhealthy, I know. But today I take an exam. It starts at 9 am and I have to take a 7-hour bus if I want to arrive on time. I’m going to take a cold shower, to have a big coffee before getting there.
Here I am in the bus. The people around me look tired too; I’m not the only one. But I think about my exam. I don’t like mathematics at all, I find it abstract, and there are too many rules. What’s the sense of all these rules? To tell the truth I don’t understand some of them.
The exam begins in ten minutes. I sit down and have a look at the other students, they are calm, and it seems they know everything. It’s only me who does not know. I’m sure I’ll be the only who will fail this exam, because I have not prepared enough. But I try not to panic.
I have just handed in my paper, the test is over. It has been lasting for three hours. I feel relieved. I answered all the questions. Several of them were difficult, but I answered at random. An average mark will suffice me, I am not ambitious.
I have lunch with Carol. The exam was a disaster for her. She tells me that she remained a lot of questions without answering. We talked about mathematics during the whole meal. I would like to discuss something else with her, but that moment she thought only of that. She was worried and upset.
After lunch, I go to the library. I meet Simon in front of the Mathematics books. He tells me that this exam was really easy, that he had no problem. Simon is modest as always! But it’s true; he’s the best of our group.
And again I am in the bus, I return. The people around me look even more tired than in the morning. They spent the whole day at work. Some people read or text, others listen to the music, others watch the landscape out of the window, others are sleepy. I want to get home, have a good dinner and go to bed in the end.
There are a lot of people who wants to move and live in the UK. Most of all people are even dreaming of it, but certainly they don’t know everything about the weather in Britain.
In the spring the weather is mild in some parts of Britain. It rains a lot, especially in the west and in the centre of England. You can never be right about the weather for a day. You can get wet through and in twenty minutes the sun appears. If you go out without an umbrella, this means it will be raining for sure.
In summer the weather is better. The south and the east parts are the warmest parts. Average temperatures can reach 30 degrees on some days. At the end of summer it is getting foggy more often.
In autumn it’s windy and foggy; and it rains quite often. This season can be called neither too cold nor warm.
In winter there are a few sunny days. In the south of England you can see blue sky sometimes. But as a rule it is very cold, and the sky is often cloudy. Especially it can be noticed in the north and east. Winter is not very pleasant in these regions.

This week there is traffic jams more often. Buses, taxis, everything is blocked. In such situations I take the subway. I live 20 minutes from the metro station, but if I walk fast, it takes about 12 minutes. But when I take the subway, after I have to spend 30 minutes to go to the office. That is why I prefer to go by bus.
I have a direct way without changing the transport. If it rains, I also take the bus. After that if I take the subway, my office is one hour from home. And it is about 40 minutes if I take the bus. I can also go by tram; it is cheaper a bit but it is much longer. I have to go a lot of stops.
In summer I have to go by bicycle when there is a traffic jam. It takes about an hour and a half. It’s a bit long but much faster than walking. I have not to complain too much because the weather forecast is good for this week. And if there is a lot of traffic jams, I will get to the office and enjoy the nice weather.

They have bread or toasts for breakfast. They put peanut butter or jam on the bread. They also drink coffee with milk, tea or hot chocolate. Someone prefers a bowl of milk with cereals. Of course, it depends on the families, but they can also have a fruit juice or eat yoghurt.
At the middle of a day there is time for lunch. At lunch they eat more than at breakfast. There is often an appetizer, a main course and a dessert. They can choose a light salad with grated carrots and apples.
For the main course there is often meat. It may be chicken, beef or pork. Also they prefer ham and sausages. The meat is served with fried potatoes, pasta, beans or rice. If they live near the sea, they eat more fish. For the dessert they have a fruit or a cake. They prefer drink more mineral water or finish their meal with a cup of coffee.
In the evening they have dinner after 7 pm. Every family has their own traditions how to spend it. Someone goes out to the restaurant; another family gets together at home. It depends on their habits. Of course, it can happen that people spend quiet evening alone. In this situation they can prefer croissants with herbal tea.

John is American. He’s from Boston. He arrived in Saint Petersburg 2 years ago and he doesn’t want to go back to the United States. He often thinks about his country, but he likes Saint Petersburg way of life. In fact, he would like to live here and work in the United States but that’s difficult.
John likes to go out, he often meets friends on the weekends or he goes to have a bite with them. In general, they can talk about everything such as work, girls, sports, etc. He often goes to the cinema; he goes there once a week. He would like to go there more often but he doesn’t have much time because of his work.
When John goes to the cinema, he’s always alone. He doesn’t like being with someone when he watches a movie. His friends find it rather strange. But such a way of loneliness is good and comfortable for John. He doesn’t need to say anything about the movie, for example “it was awesome” or “I liked the moment when the guy walks alone in the night” and etc.
As he goes alone, he can continue to think of the film while he comes back home.
My friend is an interesting and clever person. It’s pleasant for me to be friends with him.
